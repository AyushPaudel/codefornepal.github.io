&lt;p&gt;MBA student at KUSOM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nepal had seen the steady rise of the e-commerce sector primarily because of the rising of secure and easy e-payment systems, emerging e-commerce platforms like DARAZ, Sastodeal and the growth of small entrepreneurs using social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to sell their products. But, it was the COVID lockdowns that had a major role in the current rapid growth of e-commerce. According to NRB, the amount of online transactions reached Rs. 4.93 trillion in the first nine months of FY 2021 compared to Rs. 2 trillion in the same time period in the previous year. E-commerce companies like Daraz and Sastodeal grew by 100 per cent in terms of volume and value respectively in the year 2021 (Prasain, 2021).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the growth of e-commerce in Nepal, me and my friends did a small study on “Consumers’ attitude towards online shopping” as a part of our project. The questionnaire was prepared by Shachee Shrestha, Aastha Kayastha and Kshitiz Vaidya. With the data available, I did some analysis using R. This article will showcase some of my skills in R that I have gained so far as a “Data Fellow 2021” of “Code for Nepal”. The article/blog will focus on data visualization &amp;amp; the regression analysis of the responses as well as why &amp;amp; how I did in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-data-manipulation&quot;&gt;1. Data Manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study focused on understanding how consumer attitude is affected by four different factors: security of online transactions, web design, the reputation of online retailers and price and deals. For the study, Likert scales were used which ranged from 1 to 5 i.e. 1 – Strongly Disagree, 2 – Disagree, 3 – Neither Agree/Disagree, 4 – Agree and 5 – Strongly Agree. Most works on data cleaning and manipulation were done on MS Excel. The only data manipulation I did on R was creating new columns of an average of the above-mentioned variables. The questionnaire included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Four questions related to security variable; each of them coded as SEC_1, SEC_2, SEC_3 and SEC_4.Four questions related to web-design variable; each of them coded as WEB_1, WEB_2, WEB_3 and WEB_4.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five questions related to reputation variable; each of them coded as REP_1, REP_2, REP_3, REP_4 and REP_5.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five questions related to price and deals variable; each of them coded as PRC_1, PRC_2, PRC_3, PRC_4 and PRC_5.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four questions related to attitude variable; each of them coded as ATT_1, ATT_2, ATT_3 and ATT_4.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;create-average-columns-for-security-web-design-reputation-and-price--deals-variable&quot;&gt;Create average columns for security, web design, reputation and price &amp;amp; deals variable&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;consumer_behaviour1 &amp;lt;- consumer_behaviour %&amp;gt;%&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;mutate(sec_avg = as.integer((SEC_1 + SEC_2 + SEC_3 + SEC_4) / 4),&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     web_avg = as.integer((WEB_1 + WEB_2 + WEB_3 + WEB_4) / 4),

     rep_avg = as.integer((REP_1 + REP_2 + REP_3 + REP_4 + REP_5) / 5),

     prc_avg = as.integer((PRC_1 + PRC_2 + PRC_3 + PRC_4 + PRC_5) / 5),

     att_avg = as.integer((ATT_1 + ATT_2 + ATT_3 + ATT_4) / 4))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-visualizing-the-likert-scales&quot;&gt;3. Visualizing the Likert Scales&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have plotted Likert scales using violin plots from the ggplot2 package. Visualizing the Likert scales in R would have been better with Likert or HH packages. Instead, I have chosen ggplot2. Though Likert plots using Likert or HH are visually appealing, there are some advantages of visualizing Likert data in violin plots. For example, one can integrate a boxplot within the violin plot or even show mean, median, standard deviation points individually within the violin plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every variable, there is a certain number of questions measured on the Likert scale of which the average has been taken and plotted. Interpreting the plots has been quite challenging to me. If anyone reading this article would like to help me with that, your help will be appreciated. Similarly, in the following violin plots, black dots represent the median of the response of a certain variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-model-selection&quot;&gt;4. Model Selection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting a good model is not an easy task. A model with “too many” predictors can result in an overfitted model i.e. model that gives low bias but high variance with poor predictions while a model with “too few” predictors result in an under-fitted model i.e. model that gives low variance but high bias with poor predictions. Criteria for model selection must incorporate the goodness of fit and parsimony. A good model balance bias and variance to get good predictions. There are various methods for model selection like adjusted R-square, Akaike’s Information Criterion, Bayesian (BIC). I will be using the AIC method for the determination of the best model of regression here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;41-akaikes-information-criterion&quot;&gt;4.1 Akaike’s Information Criterion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIC was developed by the Japanese statistician Hirotugu Akaike. It considers both the fit of the model as well as the number of parameters in the model. A higher number of parameters result in more penalty. The model fit is measured as the likelihood of the parameters being correct for the population based on the observed sample. Hence, AIC equals the number of parameters minus the likelihood of the overall model. In conclusion, we select the model with the lowest AIC value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In R, we can use the AICcmodavg package to determine the AIC values of a different model. If there are p number of predictors, the total number of models that can be formed is 2^p. For simplicity, I have only used linear models. The models can be formed in R as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Forming the regression models

sec_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ sec_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

web_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ web_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

rep_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ rep_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

prc_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ prc_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

sec_avg.web_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ sec_avg + web_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

sec_avg.rep_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ sec_avg + rep_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

web_avg.rep_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ web_avg + rep_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

sec_avg.web_avg.rep_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ sec_avg + web_avg + rep_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

web_avg.rep_avg.prc_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ web_avg + rep_avg + prc_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

rep_avg.prc_avg.sec_avg.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ sec_avg + rep_avg + prc_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

combination.mod &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ sec_avg + web_avg + rep_avg + prc_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIC can be determined in R as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQH8F6fC3lLwnQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1647879087269?e=2147483647&amp;amp;v=beta&amp;amp;t=8YT6lmiCiWVUXAJJV-rxg-oP7Il8ugwosp5nOoASn_U&quot; alt=&quot;No alt text provided for this image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this output, we can clearly see sec_avg.web_avg.rep_avg.mod has the lowest AICc value i.e. 87.37457 followed by sec_avg.web_avg.mod i.e. 87.57156. Since the difference in AICc between the models is so low that one can argue that we better choose the second model because K = 4 for the second model vs. K = 5 for the first. In such scenarios, it is better to take the help of other model selection methods along with AIC to select the best model. But here I will be selecting the first model i.e sec_avg.web_avg.rep_avg.mod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-test-of-homoscedasticity&quot;&gt;5. Test of Homoscedasticity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important assumption of multiple regression analysis is that data needs to show homoscedasticity i.e. variance of the dependent variable is the same for all data. In R, we can simply perform a homoscedasticity test using the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Test of Homoscedasticity

res &amp;lt;- resid(sec_avg.web_avg.rep_avg.mod)

plot(fitted(sec_avg.web_avg.rep_avg.mod), res)

abline(0,0))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHyWf3XhR-YkA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1647917455340?e=2147483647&amp;amp;v=beta&amp;amp;t=lDVdAnLI32cjaNen5hsQ4OndxuCBFpwytmJPszksbds&quot; alt=&quot;No alt text provided for this image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This plot shows that residuals are pretty symmetrically distributed around the line. Hence, we can conclude that assumption of homoscedasticity hasn’t been violated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-q-q-plot&quot;&gt;6. Q-Q plot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantile-quantile plot helps to determine if the residuals follow the normal distribution. If all the points on the plot lie on the straight line, we can conclude that the distribution is normally distributed. In R, the Q-Q plot can be shown with the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Creates the q-q plot

qqnorm(res) 
 
#Creates the line in the plot                  

qqline(res)       
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQG7QmaH9va0sw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1647919821000?e=2147483647&amp;amp;v=beta&amp;amp;t=N2M-vBxvHU_90l4ncwsMTtnNb2VC7O7-CG4C2sQ08q0&quot; alt=&quot;No alt text provided for this image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see in the plot, the residuals tend to stray away from the straight line hence, the distribution may not be perfectly normally distributed. The distribution is somewhat right-skewed. This indicates that we need to do some transformation in our model. But in our case, since this article focuses on some basics of performing regression analysis, I will be using the same model without any transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-regression-analysis&quot;&gt;7. Regression Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the model selected above, regression analysis in R can be performed as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Regression Analysis

model &amp;lt;- lm(att_avg ~ sec_avg + web_avg  + rep_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

summary(model)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHdaFrhycSp1g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1647880184606?e=2147483647&amp;amp;v=beta&amp;amp;t=Er6c2gf-tHtwWPmz2Lrw-YcLp2ASX1CEHmc6n6En43Q&quot; alt=&quot;No alt text provided for this image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this output, our regression model is att_avg = 1.594 + 0.1215 sec_avg + 0.1973 web_avg + 0.0802 rep_avg . Here, 0.1215, 0.1973 and 0.0802 are regression coefficients of sec_avg, web_avg and rep_avg. Regression coefficient of sec_avg is 0.1215 indicates that if security variable increases by 1 scale, attitude variable increases by 0.1215 scale. Other regression coefficients can be explained likewise. At 5% level of significance, sec_avg and web_avg are statistically significant since their p-values i.e. 0.0334 &amp;amp; 0.001 respectively are less than alpha = 0.05. Adjusted R-square of the model is 0.399 indicates 39.9% variance of dependendt variable is explained by these three predictors. P-value of overall model is 2.87e-11 is lower than 0.05 hence, the overall model is statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-analysis-of-variances&quot;&gt;8. Analysis of Variances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANOVA or Analysis of variances is a statistical test that determines whether there is a difference in means of groups at each level of the independent variable. It estimates how a quantitative dependent variable changes at different levels of one or more categorical independent variables. In R, ANOVA can be performed as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Performing anova analysis

anova &amp;lt;- aov(att_avg ~ sec_avg + web_avg + rep_avg, data = consumer_behaviour1)

summary(anova)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQF76QNr-d8LNQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1647952353227?e=2147483647&amp;amp;v=beta&amp;amp;t=WuNOBx6WFbG3Z7yaNxkaBbB_ZozQ-LwaFyFMeTvnXpI&quot; alt=&quot;No alt text provided for this image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People argue that Likert scale data cannot be treated as continuous and multiple linear regression analysis cannot be performed. Hence, I have used an average of each variable for the analysis. With dependent and independent variables in Likert scale data, it is encouraged to perform ordinal logistic regression instead of linear regression. This article summarizes the study on “Consumer attitude towards online shopping in Nepal” and how I performed it using R. All thanks goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/&quot;&gt;Code for Nepal&lt;/a&gt; for providing me with a wonderful opportunity to learn R.&lt;/p&gt;

He likes to blog and share his love for data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are considering a career in the field of data, or if you have limited experience and want to learn more about it, this blog is for you. Continue reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What inspired you to join the Data Fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of practical data science experience and frequently do data visualization and information design work. I had a gut feeling that I needed to push myself and explore more of the topics in the data domain. 
Data engineers are on the front lines of data strategy so that others don’t need to be. They are the first to deal with the inflow of structured and unstructured data into a business’s systems. Any data strategy would be incomplete without them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my LinkedIn network, I have seen people talking about data engineering and how it shaped all projects in data science. Finally, I decided I should explore being a data engineer.
Then, as with anything else in this digital era, I searched for an online program where I could learn data engineering, and because I’m from Nepal, one of the criteria we use when looking for something is that it must be available for free.
As a result, I was looking for a free data engineering course. Coursera, edx, udemy, and DataCamp are all places where I frequently engage. While investigating, I came across a few data engineering bootcamps in the United States. They meet the first but not the second of my criteria: they should be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, after a few weeks, one day I came upon a Code for Nepal post on LinkedIn. I wasn’t a stranger to Code for Nepal. Back in the day, I did some volunteer work. 
My heart leapt with delight and the thirst to learn as soon as I noticed the data fellowship post partnering with data camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applied for the fellowship with high hopes, and I was accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c.tenor.com/hDZ1GpsJnDsAAAAM/amazing-dwight.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I began my three-month data fellowship with Code For Nepal and DataCamp after completing my orientation. I chose the data engineering career path and began my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How difficult was the fellowship journey?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was totally tough. It was filled with deadlines and completing the course was not easy. During the first 4–6 weeks, I studied 49 hours a week. But after 3 weeks, the learning process was impeded due to family responsibilities. At that time, I had two options: I could drop out and offer my spot to other students looking for similar opportunities, or I could stay and push myself without any excuses. Guess what? I chose to push myself and manage my time, and lastly, you are reading this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://64.media.tumblr.com/b95e9bfb83db0d66dd71de5e54918695/tumblr_pq6xg1LsCN1qisc9uo2_r1_500.gifv&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What lessons did you learn from The Fellowship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered that everyone, no matter how confident or successful they appear, suffers from self-doubt and imposter syndrome. What matters is that you feel the fear and go ahead and do it anyhow. Simply adopt a learning attitude and keep an eye out for opportunities. When they present themselves, seize the opportunity without further delay. Also, I learned that individuals are willing to assist if I know how to ask and what I require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you suggest Data Fellowship to a friend?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, absolutely!  Beyond all the amazing resources, sessions, and opportunities, The Fellowship is an experience that will make a difference in many aspects of your life. It did in my life and will shape lots of areas. For those that are currently feeling unfulfilled in their career and are not sure what their next move is, The Fellowship will help you identify your skills, values, and what’s important to you in your career and will help you push beyond your comfort zone by equipping you with the skills. Data engineering, data science, data analysis, machine learning and much more. All you have to do is decide and be disciplined about the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any words to future fellowship seekers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lookout for the next cohort and apply without hesitation. As Code for Nepal is offering free access to DataCamp, all you need is time and a desire to learn.Remember, Albert Einstein once said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The only source of knowledge is experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was right, but it does not have to be your experience. 
You can leverage knowledge from other people’s lessons. You can stand on the shoulders of giants. Like Stand on the shoulders of DataCamp and Code for Nepal and pave your career the way you intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you doing right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I’m working on a data engineering project and writing some blogs. If you enjoy reading, please have a look at my few blogs on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@maladeep.upadhaya&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think. (Oh, did I mention that if you haven’t developed a love of reading, you should check out my blog; who knows, it might pique your interest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to express my gratitude to Code for Nepal for providing a fantastic opportunity to the Nepali community, as well as DataCamp for believing in Code for Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

She loves solving environment problems using data science and machine learning, especially time series analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data science is the study of extracting information from huge data to support decision-making. It is one of the most powerful tools for discovering and evaluating complex problems, generating solutions, and tracking progress. Today, data science has overtaken practically every industry in the world. It has become a power source for businesses, having a profound impact on banking, finance, manufacturing, e-commerce, education, and health industries. However, to this date, the applications of data science have been very less when it comes to understanding the natural environment and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studies of the natural environment such as geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, climate, and atmosphere are increasingly data rich. These data can be utilized to support research and come up with the solution for major environmental projects ranging from climate monitoring to wildlife protection to waste management. With this article, I aim to highlight my experience of using Data Science in an environmental project and some of the applications of Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Data-Driven Environmental World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is linked with everything we do. Data is utilized to capture our actions, from posting on social media to buying groceries at the shop to calories that we consume. Likewise, data is also tied to every aspect of the environment, such as yearly precipitation and temperature, changes in the volume of glaciers, number of protected species, etc. Both data science and environmental science are interdisciplinary fields. Look at the air pollution photo below. This is an area where results can be made based on a variety of levels, based on many interconnected variables such as health and pollution, crop production and pollution, etc. Environmental science fields such as climatic variables, pollution, etc. are becoming more data-driven, and they are moving toward open-sourcing their data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/ashmasubedi0/US-No2-prediction-using-ARIMA/raw/master/DSC_0053.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging and intriguing projects that I have even done in this coding world was on Time Series Analysis of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Time series modeling is a powerful method to describe and extract information from time-based data and helps to make informed decisions about future outcomes. Thanks to this project, now I can retrieve CSV dataset, visualize and transform the dataset into times series, test whether the time series is stationary or not, transform time series to stationary, build seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model using grid search method, and finally predict NO2 (shown below). More details of this can be found on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ashmasubedi0/US-No2-prediction-using-ARIMA&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/ashmasubedi0/US-No2-prediction-using-ARIMA/raw/master/arima.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated when I first came across an interesting technique that could be used to explore enormous datasets in novel ways to get forecasted results. After receiving quite interesting results with the ARIMA model, my curiosity for Data Science increased more.
Data science, in my opinion, is the future of data and the environment. That is the only way to assure that you get outstanding outcomes in a timely, repeatable, and consistent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Data Fellowship 2022 organized by Code for Nepal will further help me in my environmental career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am enrolled in career building Data Analyst with Python course to gain experience in coding skills. The course focuses on applied learning, which means I am addressing problems using real-world datasets, which is the best part of this course. The data science skills that I have learned at the Data Fellowship so far came in handy when it came to manipulating and visualizing the data. While the lectures were an important part of their course, the actual learning happened while working on projects and doing hands-on exercises. These exercises were practical, entertaining, and enlightening, and they provided an excellent opportunity for me to put what I had learned in the lectures into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, after the completion of this course, Data Analyst with Python, I am sure that I will be able to analyze data-driven modeling approach, data- and knowledge-based approaches for disaster risk management, and approaches for uncertainty reduction with climatic vulnerability such as floods, droughts, etc. The approaches for uncertainty reduction can be done by combining diverse sources of data to create augmented claims, which then help in the creation of a vulnerability model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application of Data Science in the environment world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science can have an impact on the earth and environmental sciences, providing a rich tapestry of new techniques to support both a deeper understanding of the natural environment in all its complexities and the development of well-founded climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Some of the applications of data science that can be used in the environment field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting and prediction&lt;/strong&gt;: The world’s most pressing environmental issues till today are climate change, floods, droughts, renewables energy, etc. All these issues are directly or indirectly heavily weather dependent such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. As a result, forecasting has become more critical in managing supply and demand, which must be balanced in real-time. From numerical weather predictions and historical data, data science allows us to develop reliable precipitation forecasts (which can be used to minimize the impacts of floods and droughts), wind forecasts (which can be used for more precise wind power production), temperature forecasts (which can be used to minimize the impacts of forest fire).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better policy-making/ decisions&lt;/strong&gt;: There are many success stories of how rivers have improved their water quality after suffering waste pollution mainly from industrial areas. Looking at this data, we can identify and measure the effectiveness of regulatory interventions and inform future policy decisions. Using data science, we can better understand how our environment is changing, what might be driving those changes, how to manage the state of our environment better, and even how to consider what might happen in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaster risk reduction planning&lt;/strong&gt;: Risks, vulnerabilities, and resilience may all be measured and understood with the use of data science. It is critical for disaster response, recovery, and planning. Improved resilience is achieved through risk assessment and risk reduction and data science can assist us in comprehending how disaster risk may evolve in the future. 
Data science can be applied in all fields of environmental science including but not limited to the climate, energy, geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere. With this data fellowship, I realized that environmental scientists, hydrologists, climate researchers should be encouraged and supported to create a culture shift toward open science, i.e., a science which is more collaborative and integrative through open approaches to data, models, and knowledge development, as well as more transparent, repeatable, and reproducible science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get involved with data and data science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Science is a new field with new technologies and the use of new approaches. We can draw insight from data and help build actionable and innovative solutions. However, the greatest approach to understanding a thing is to plunge in and practice it rather than studying its definition. Some of the ways are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn about statistics as statistical knowledge is important&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get comfortable with R or Python as both the languages can be/ are extensively used in environmental projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn about data analysis, manipulation, and visualization with pandas as these will significantly increase your efficiency when working with data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try your data science environmental project. For example, try extracting and analyzing data from the internet such as data related to air pollution or the maximum temperature of Nepal for the last 20 years. Use these data for analysis, visualization and try making the best out of them.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always knew I would find myself in the tech industry from a very young age. But as I entered my 20s , I was clueless regarding which sector to choose in the IT industry. To find where my true passion lies, I had planned to explore every sector in the IT industry. With this purpose, I applied for a Data Fellowship organized by Code For Nepal and got accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the most out of the opportunity and leisure time that pandemic offered me, I allocated 2 hours of my morning to learn even if that meant I had to be a morning person from a night owl. Each day I was enthusiastically learning and I felt more accomplished. During my tenure as a Data Fellow, I completed  two courses from Career track : “Python Programmer” and “Data Scientist with Python”. All thanks to DataCamp, where lectures videos were informative, tutorials were effective and exercises were interactive and engaging. This all made my learning fun and not monotonous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Data Fellow, I didn’t have much idea about the impact that Code for Nepal was making until the networking event. After having insights about the organization , a part of me wanted to be part of the team and contribute to the cause . Then, I reached out to Ravi ( Founder and volunteer of Code for Nepal ) about my interest in volunteering . I also remember being asked , “Do I really want to do all the boring stuff that falls in program management?”. After fully convincing Ravi, I was part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a part of the team was different from being a data fellow. I had more power but had even more responsibilities. I was working with people who were already experts in their field. The perks of being the youngest one in the team is that you will be guided by professionals who are experienced . They encourage and bring the best out of you. I had the same perks , I was learning while assisting the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the grateful moments that I realized was when I got a chance to review applications of potential to-be Data Fellows.Reading through the lines I realized there were people in Nepal who have been deprived from learning but were doing everything in their hand to learn. At that moment , I felt grateful to be part of the team to provide access to those people.At that moment , I felt like the clueless guy found his Ikigai, a concept that emerged in Japan that says we are happy when we do something that gives us a sense of purpose. For me that sense of purpose lies in giving back to the community .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that moment on , I have been working actively, assisting my team to manage and coordinate the Fellowship program.I plan to use my knowledge in the field of computer science and link it to make an impact in the field of education. Looking back, joining code for Nepal  has been really fruitful personally and professionally. I have leveled up , made connections and developed a work ethic. I am pumped up more than ever to contribute to the cause and to make a difference through Code for Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Prayatna Mishra</name></author><category term="highlight" /><category term="Datacampdonates" /><category term="Data Fellowship 2021" /><category term="CodeforNepal" /><summary type="html">Prayatna Mishra is an undergraduate student currently studying in Deerwalk Institute of technology.

&lt;p&gt;I am Binita Gyawali, a graduate of Computer Science and Information Technology from Butwal Multiple Campus. I have been exploring the fields of data science and artificial intelligence for about six months. My research interest is in different applications of data science and artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working since my freshman year to fill the gender gap in the tech community of Nepal, especially Province no. 5. A strong proponent of girls’ coding, I co-founded Butwal Coder Girls, a non-profit organization, in 2016 to motivate girls in coding, either as a hobby or as a career. Now, after exploring data science and seeing the landscape of girls’ involvement in data science, I feel more girls should be encouraged to pursue careers in data science, data engineering, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have you learned from DataCamp\how DataCamp has benefitted you so far?&lt;/strong&gt; 
I had no prior experience with data science or programming. I wanted to learn Python programming and do some data science. As a result, I looked into instructions from a variety of places. I felt bewildered in the new world of programming and data science when I referred to those materials. Put it simply, there was too much to catch. Things were not as well arranged as I had hoped. As a result, I was frustrated and contemplated quitting programming at one point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But everything changed when I got access to DataCamp through Code for Nepal Fellowship program. I was finally able to organize my studies. DataCamp provided step-by-step instruction in the form of skill and career tracks. That was precisely what I needed. Another feature of this Fellowship that I like was the ability to learn anything I wanted in DataCamp. I struggled with basic programming principles on several instances, and happily, DataCamp allowed me to take any basic classes or view any basic programming videos I chose.  DataCamp acted as a mentor for me with its guided projects that inspired me to pursue Python and data science as a career because I was able to observe how the skills I gained were applied in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the Data Fellowship from Code for Nepal supported you in your career growth?&lt;/strong&gt;
Despite being a major fan of data science, I never got the chance to work in it. I’d always wanted to understand how to convert raw data into a tidy, appealing manner. Presenting data in the form of beautiful graphs has always piqued my interest. When I was in school, I used to tinker with excel whenever I had any data. My bucket list item is to learn how to analyze data using mathematical models. Data cleansing, data analysis, data visualization, and data modeling are among my best hobbies to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit my job to pursue my true calling: data science. I came across the data fellowship offered by Code for Nepal and Open Knowledge Nepal and applied instantly. The data fellowship encouraged me to follow my interest in data science by researching and beginning to combine my career in the field. Observing other students conduct intriguing work motivated me to leverage data to create data-driven analytical tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two months of diligently seeking the fellowship, I was offered a data science internship with Open Knowledge Nepal, which marked the start of my professional data science journey. Right now, I’m merely scratching the surface of data science. I aspire to improve in my career with time and experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the other benefits of this Fellowship, apart from the datacamp subscription?&lt;/strong&gt; 
Bringing attention to DataCamp is one of the numerous ways Code for Nepal is attempting to assist us in developing data skills. This Fellowship has several advantages, including assisting in the development of my portfolio and encouraging networking. For me, the “Data Fellowship” is my first data science involvement, thus it is quite valuable. This fellowship program has stood out in my resume and reflected well in my portfolio, as attested by HR experts and project managers from the several firms I interviewed for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you believe the next step is in your career, and how can we help you get there?&lt;/strong&gt;
After completing my bachelor’s degree in computer science and information technology, I am eager to gain more experience in the field of computer vision and further develop my research interests. So, the next stage in my career will be to continue my education in America. As a result, I am excited to apply for a Ph.D. in computer science with a computer vision emphasis in the fall of 2022.
Code for Nepal, I believe, has a strong professional network both within and outside Nepal. It would be extremely beneficial if Code for Nepal could assist me in connecting with AI research professionals (such as Ph.D. students, researchers, professors, and others) with whom I could work as a research assistant (even on a volunteer basis) or receive mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Binita Gyawali</name></author><category term="highlight" /><category term="Datacampdonates" /><category term="Data Fellowship 2021" /><category term="CodeforNepal" /><summary type="html">Binita Gyawali, a graduate of Computer Science and Information Technology from Butwal Multiple Campus, data Science journey with Code for Nepal and Open Knowledge Nepal.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Code For Nepal Data Fellowship Experience as an Actuarial Science Student</title><link href="/2021/06/26/My-Code-For-Nepal-Data-Fellowship-Experience-as-an-Actuarial-Science.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Code For Nepal Data Fellowship Experience as an Actuarial Science Student" /><published>2021-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-06-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2021/06/26/My-Code-For-Nepal-Data-Fellowship-Experience-as-an-Actuarial-Science</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2021/06/26/My-Code-For-Nepal-Data-Fellowship-Experience-as-an-Actuarial-Science.html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone who is reading my blog, hello and Namaste. Hello, my name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishna-kumar-shrestha-20a35b172/&quot;&gt;Krishna Kumar Shrestha&lt;/a&gt;, and I am now studying for a bachelor’s degree in Actuarial Science at Tribhuvan University. I was born in Banepa and currently reside in Kathmandu. My favorite subject has always been mathematics, and I’ve always wanted to work in disciplines linked to mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to major in actuarial science, which entails a lot of statistics and mathematics. As an actuarial student, being able to interpret vast amounts of data is essential. I had been studying programming languages such as C, C++, MATLAB, and R to prepare for this. The only thing I lacked was practical data experience. I learned about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally.html&quot;&gt;DataCamp fellowship from Code for Nepal&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago when browsing LinkedIn. I applied after learning of this and was fortunate enough to be chosen. After receiving the scholarship from Code for Nepal, I began working on projects to gain hands-on experience. But I had the impression that I lacked the necessary talents to execute them. So, from DataCamp, I chose a professional path as a Data Analyst utilizing R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past three months, DataCamp has been my best buddy and I am thoroughly enjoying the companionship it provides. I am grateful to Code for Nepal for allowing me to participate in this fellowship. DataCamp required a lot of hands-on coding, which I didn’t love at first. At times, I was concerned and wondered aloud, “Will I be able to stay motivated to finish this course?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as time went on, I found that practice questions had assisted me in learning more. Those inquiries compelled me to delve further into the intricacies, hunt for more information and groomed me along the way. You know, I used to earn very little XP because I couldn’t solve many questions at first, but I progressively tried, started solving problems on my own, and performed well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial thing I learned from this data fellowship is professionalism in data analysis. It has changed my vision to explore the data and I was able to generate innovative ideas from data. When I used to do my project in college, most of the time I got clean data for my analysis. But in the real world, the situation is completely different. Most of the time we will get unstructured and dirty data and we must spend too much time cleaning them. This means whatever we learned, cannot be applied until we clean them. So, what I found out is that the data camp has designed its track to fulfill these gaps and provide students with real-world skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m having so much fun at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datacamp.com&quot;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve decided to pursue a career as a Data Scientist using R because &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org&quot;&gt;Code for Nepal&lt;/a&gt; has motivated me to make the most of this opportunity. In a similar vein, I’m nearing the end of my certification process. Hopefully, I will complete the task and acquire DataCamp certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to thank the Code for Nepal team for giving me this opportunity and for arranging so many inspiring events for youth like me to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Krishna kumar Shrestha</name></author><category term="Datacampdonates" /><category term="Data Fellowship 2021" /><category term="CodeforNepal" /><summary type="html">Everyone who is reading my blog, hello and Namaste.

Looking back, it’s difficult for me to summarize the journey in words; almost 5 years went by within the blink of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started, I wanted to be focused on leading one initiative, which was AskNepal; but as time progressed I remember volunteering for so many interdisciplinary projects, programs and positions. Unfortunately, this awesome journey will come to halt this April 2021, as I step down and bid farewell to Code for Nepal community. So yay, I might not be actively engaged in the community activities and projects from April onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this decision to bid farewell wasn’t easy for me but a year-long pandemic has made my personal and professional life a little messy; forcing me to take some major decisions to collect life back to normal. Also, I believe 5 years is a long time and this is a good time for me to move on; so other volunteers can utilize the community platform and get a similar opportunity to contribute and prove themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still will be wondering and struggling in the field of data and technology. So, if anyone wants to reach out; my email nikeshbalami@gmail.com) will be always open for collaboration. The aim is to make sure that everyone has free and open access to the key information, empowering themselves to be able to make decisions about their own lives based on the information that wasn’t available before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflecting on the journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaping AskNepal initiative - my project plan to &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2016/10/rebooting-asknepal-initiative/&quot;&gt;reboot the entire initiative&lt;/a&gt; was a complete flop, but we made some progress in terms of further enhancing the project. We successfully brought the project under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://asknepal.info/en/help/about&quot;&gt;joint partnership&lt;/a&gt; of Open Knowledge Nepal and Code for Nepal, to ease its implementation. Also, with the support from OKN colleagues, Sagar Ghimire &amp;amp; Shubham Ghimire, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mysociety/asknepal-theme/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;improved the user interface&lt;/a&gt;. We also were able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transifex.com/mysociety/alaveteli/&quot;&gt;localize the platform in the Nepali language&lt;/a&gt;, many thanks to the volunteers of Kathmandu University and the guidance of Saroj Dhakal. Unfortunately, we were never able to acquire dedicated funding to support the outreach activities of the project. The good-looking project proposal remains in my Google drive. If someone is still looking to support, feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing #DigitalNepal conference - In the midst of tragic events and strike at province 2, we successfully organized the Digital Nepal conference at Janakpur, which was one of the biggest out of Kathmandu valley technology events. A little nervous, a little excited; I remember my friend Avinash and I, taking a flight from Kathmandu. It was all worth it and many thanks to Pratap Adhikari, who then was a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ayon.org&quot;&gt;Association of Youth Organizations Nepal (AYON)&lt;/a&gt;, for making it memorable, by helping us explore the entire Janakpur. You can read my take on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2017/04/diversity-and-enthusiasm-my-take-on-digital-nepal-conference-janakpur/&quot;&gt;Digital Nepal conference&lt;/a&gt;, the event was full of enthusiasm with diverse audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building civic tools - Something I love, crowdsourcing the idea and converting it into impactful projects with the help of wonderful volunteers. Out of many, one of the memorable projects was the &lt;a href=&quot;(https://codefornepal.org/2017/04/election-nepal-a-mediator-between-citizens-and-government-for-election-data/)&quot;&gt;Election Nepal portal&lt;/a&gt;, although the portal wasn’t sustainable for a longer period. I have shared the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/open-nepal/online-collaboration-by-nepals-data-community-yields-a-portal-for-opening-local-election-data-d425986f8194&quot;&gt;journey of online collaboration in building the portal&lt;/a&gt; with the Open Nepal team, feel free to read. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okfnepal/election-nepal&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/okfnepal/election-nepal-data&quot;&gt;datasets&lt;/a&gt; are also openly available for everyone to reuse. Another project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitjanakpur.com/&quot;&gt;Visit Janakpur&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn’t involved in the development of the project, but helping the team organize the “Digitizing Janakpur Workshop” was fun. At the end of the three and half days workshop, we built 542 map points, 55 plus 360-degree imageries and 12 video stories. You can read more details regarding how we helped improve the digital footprint of Janakpur from my [blog]https://codefornepal.org/2018/11/improving-digital-footprint-of-janakpur/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosting local and global events - In the span of 5 years, I remember helping in the coordination of many events, that too in various parts of the country. Some of them include Smart Cities Workshop, in partnership with Global Peace Foundation; AngelHack Hackathon with support from ING Group, DataHack 2019 to map the districts affected by the monsoon in Nepal, 2019 Digitizing Janakpur Workshop to map the street of Janakpur on OpenStreetMap and Digital Literacy Training at Sindhupalchowk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving NepalMap portal - When I first joined Code for Nepal community; NepalMap was already a thing with a very good user base. I feel very grateful that I got an opportunity to work with both teams who developed the old pre-federal and new federal version of NepalMap, especially with Clifton McIntosh, who despite being non-Nepali got such a deep understanding of Nepal. In the pre-federal version, I contributed the local elections and business data. Adding business data was fun, where I spent quite some nights understanding its patterns, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2017/09/understanding-the-patterns-business-data-added-in-nepalmap/&quot;&gt;my experience regarding the understanding of the business data pattern&lt;/a&gt;. Which gave me confidence in coordinating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2020/02/nepalmap-federal-explore-and-understand-nepal-using-data/&quot;&gt;development of the federal version&lt;/a&gt;. Many thanks to Clifton McIntosh, Amit Chaudhary, Nitesh Rijal, Pratima Kandel, Ishan Dangol and Nirmal Rijal; without whom the development of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nepalmap.org/&quot;&gt;NepalMap Federal&lt;/a&gt; would not have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching fellowship - Helping with the launch and coordination of the different fellowship programs was also one of the memorable parts of the journey. Recent activities include the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/fellowship/&quot;&gt;Hawkins Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally.html&quot;&gt;Data Fellowship program&lt;/a&gt;, where we aim to build data skills of over 500 Nepalis globally. If you are someone who is looking for any opportunity to kickstart the carrier in the field of data, feel free to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I previously mentioned, my focus will still be in the field of data and technology, so if you are someone who works in a similar field, we definitely have a higher chance of meeting and working again. In the end, I would like to thank Ravi Kumar for his mentorship; without him, this phase of life could have been boring.&lt;/p&gt;

. I am a mechanical engineering student. I received my bachelor’s degree in 2019 from Kathmandu University. Many technological advancements radically modified machines over time, due to researchers and scientists that worked tirelessly to make things happen the way they are now. Machines, which were completely mechanically driven only a few years ago, have now begun to work automatically, thanks to programming, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other technologies. This progress piqued my curiosity, which evolved into a desire to pursue Mechanical Engineering as a bachelor’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But during my college years, I was not interested in programming; C and C++ were the only two classes I had taken in my first year. Every year, we were also required to complete engineering project work as part of our course credit. I realized the true usefulness of programming when I was in my third year because it was and still is used in almost every field. The synergistic pairing of mechanical engineering and computer science helps the upskilling in this domain. I deduced, “It is the future.” My desire to learn python grew even stronger thereafter, thanks to its simple syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about the DataCamp in 2020 from a Facebook ad. I impulsively registered for one of the courses because it was available for a limited time for free. In 2021, I accessed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/donates&quot;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt;
 for the second time, this time as a Data Fellow at Code for Nepal. I’ve enrolled in the Python Programmer and Machine Learning career track, as well as numerous other python programming courses that have helped me to develop my basic coding skills. Because I had no idea what basic coding abilities a mechanical engineer would need, I began taking courses at random, in a rush to learn everything that came my way, whether it was relevant or irrelevant to my career. I used to wonder after enrolling in a course, “Is this the right course for me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wished DataCamp had a career track titled Python for Mechanical Engineers to make things easier. I’m not sure if one exists. It took me approximately two and a half months to figure out what to learn and what to disregard at DataCamp, which covers a wide range of topics. I learned and am currently learning fundamental programming skills and tools through the Code for Nepal fellowship. It is an accomplishment for me to have progressed from nothing to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still undecided about what I want to pursue as a career, but I’m interested in becoming an automation engineer, a data scientist, or a mechanical design engineer, to name a few. Being a Data Fellow at Code for Nepal has been quite beneficial in assisting me in achieving my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I progress in my datacamp career tracks I have realized just like how Steve Jobs said in a famous Stanford commencement speech “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward”  I have to believe that the dots (code skills) will connect to what I’ll be doing in the future. Believing that the dots will join in the future motivates me to keep doing what I’m doing today. We’re getting closer to the end of the DataCamp fellowship with each passing day, and I’m starting to acquire a sense of how to make the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to participate in the Code for Nepal fellowship was one of the nicest things that have ever occurred to me, and I am grateful to Code for Nepal for providing me with this fantastic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nabin Joshi</name></author><summary type="html">I am Nabin Joshi, aData fellow at Code for Nepal .

&lt;p&gt;If you ask me if my gap year has taught me anything significant, I’d say that seeking knowledge continuously is the one thing that has stayed with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Code for Nepal came at the right time to act as a bridge when I was searching for ways to learn data science for free! How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code for Nepal launched its fellowship program where fellows would get access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/donates&quot;&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt; for $0!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I hit the jackpot and I didn’t think twice before applying because I knew it was the right fit for me. DataCamp as part of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/datacamp-donates-50-partners&quot;&gt;global effort&lt;/a&gt; to build data skills donated thousands of subscriptions to organizations and schools globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fellow at Code for Nepal, I got access to a multitude of courses and resources via &lt;a href=&quot;https://codefornepal.org/2021/02/14/launching-a-fellowship-program-to-build-data-skills-of-over-500-nepalis-globally&quot;&gt;Data Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; which let me dive deep into the data world like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was euphoric to re-learn courses interactively which I had learned via different online courses that were like traditional classes but on a computer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with Datacamp, I could code simultaneously while getting instructions. Subsequently, my learning time grew exponentially!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the time of my life exploring Business Analytics courses during my gap year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustrated, I started recording my eating habits on an excel sheet and visualized it to find patterns between my diet and its influence on my sinus problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding that dairy products and low water consumption was related to surged congestion and toothache, I changed my diet and increased water consumption to improve my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also increased my yoga time after noticing a pattern between reduced toothache and increased yoga duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, my interest in Analytics grew even more. I plan to utilize the robust analytics program at Datacamp to shape solutions to people’s problems like I did for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datacamp has courses that have helped me leverage data tools, maintaining databases, and creating and managing data analytics that helps me connect dots between marketing and analytics, improving my problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the tools, I was able to identify students’ major issues (analysis) and address them in collaboration with our startup- TheVidhwan’s- student ambassadors by acquiring and analyzing 300 student data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During college, I aspire to continue connecting the dots between marketing and analytics thereby improving my problem-solving skills. Through analysis and models, I want to create patterns and unravel mysteries about people’s behavior to have a deeper understanding of their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And through marketing, I plan to shape creative ideas to connect and communicate with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Fellowship has allowed me to indulge myself with guided and self-started projects which adds a whole new perspective to my experience as I tackle real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Datacamp has made it easy enough for me to execute such projects at the comfort of my home sipping coffee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my project, I collected, analyzed, and visualized company data of Pacific Human Resources Pvt. Ltd that is being used for the company’s marketing and its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the community that we have at Code for Nepal Fellowship is just what I needed while struggling with my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our monthly session that is led by the founder himself allowed me to get my questions answered by him and other data professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitalizing on the power of data has helped me realize how much progress we need to make as a country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for that reason, I am starting the change with myself and the people around me!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nigin Pun</name></author><category term="highlight" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
